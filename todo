Youtube:
Reimplement thumbnails
Channels icon (maybe with a little youtube icon too)

Websites:
Option to filter out clear marketing posts
Option to summarise all recent articles, combining many into a daily bulletin feed

Reddit:
Summarise all the posts into a daily bulletin feed
https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/wiki/rss/


Automatically populate miniflux


If feed was rejected due to filters, push it to a rejected feed, also make the ai write a rejection reason

options a timed_summary which if enabled doesnt output every single feed (it would still have to store all entries as usual), but idk the specifics it would at each time generate a single entry which is a summary of that days
the string would be be either a string or a vec<string> with each one being something like "8am" or "3pm" or "15:00" which i assume chrono can interpret just fine (if it cant be serialized print a warning)
then each summary is posted at that time and is a summary of all posts since the last summary
